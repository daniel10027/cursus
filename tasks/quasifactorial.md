## Description

The factorial of n is defined as the product of all natural numbers up to and including `n - 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * n`. The `quasifactorial` of n is different in that after each multiplication the result is decreased by one. So the `quasifactorial` of n is `(...((1 * 2 - 1) * 3 - 1) * ... * n - 1)`. The `quasifactorial` of 1 is 1.

Given a positive integer `n`, calculate its `quasifactorial`.

## Example

For `n = 4`, the output should be `7`.

-   [input] integer n

-   [output] integer
