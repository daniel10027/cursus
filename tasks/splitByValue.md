For an integer k rearrange all the elements of the given array in such way, that:

all elements that are less than k are placed before elements that are not less than k; all elements that are less than k remain in the same order with respect to each other; all elements that are not less than k remain in the same order with respect to each other. Example

For k = 5 and array [1, 3, 5, 7, 6, 4, 2] the answer will be [1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 7, 6].

[input] integer k

[input] array.integer elements
