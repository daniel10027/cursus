# Description

Call two integers a and b similar if divisor divides both a and b or if it doesn't divide either.

Given integers a, b and divisor, check if a and b are similar.

Example

For a = 10, b = 12 and divisor = 2, the output should be
areSimilarNumbers(a, b, divisor) = true;
For a = 10, b = 12 and divisor = 3, the output should be
areSimilarNumbers(a, b, divisor) = false.
[input] integer a
[input] integer b
[input] integer divisor

A positive integer.

[output] boolean

true if a and b are similar in respect of divisor, false otherwise.
